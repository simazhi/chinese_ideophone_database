Edit the DESCRIPTION file to reflect
the contents of your package.
Optionally put your raw data under
'inst/extdata/'. If the datasets are large,
they may reside elsewhere outside the package
source tree. If you passed R and Rmd files to
datapackage.skeleton, they should now appear in 'data-raw'.
When you call package_build(), your datasets will
be automatically documented. Edit datapackager.yml to
add additional files / data objects to the package.
After building, you should edit dat-raw/documentation.R
to fill in dataset documentation details and rebuild.

NOTES
If your code relies on other packages,
add those to the @import tag of the roxygen markup.
The R object names you wish to make available
(and document) in the package must match
the roxygen @name tags and must be listed
in the yml file.
